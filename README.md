# Cut-The-Apple

The gameplay is that you need to catch the moment the apple transitions into a state of reflection from the wall using a knife.<br>
<br>
It sounds easy, but you cannot cut an apple without using its functionality, since cutting will not work without the correct swing at the object.<br>
<br>
Points are added as you earn rewards, and there are also grades in the game.<br>
